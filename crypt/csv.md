`crypt/csv.html`, is a self-contained HTML page that provides a simple web-based tool for encrypting or decrypting text (or file contents) using a custom XOR cipher combined with Base64 encoding/decoding. Here’s a breakdown of its purpose and functionality:

---

### **Main Functionality**

- **Encrypt/Decrypt Text or File Contents**
  - The user can input text directly or upload a file (such as a CSV or plain text file). Each line is treated separately.
  - The user provides a password, which is used as a key in the XOR encryption/decryption process.
  - The user chooses between “Encrypt” and “Decrypt” modes.
  - When encrypting, each character in the input is XOR’d with a key derived from the password and the line length, then the result is Base64-encoded.
  - When decrypting, the input is first Base64-decoded, then XOR’d using the same logic to recover the original text.

### **UI Elements**

- **File Upload**: Allows the user to choose and load a file. Its contents populate the input text area.
- **Input Text Area**: Users can type or paste text to encrypt/decrypt (one entry per line).
- **Password Field**: For entering the encryption/decryption key (with option to show/hide password).
- **Encrypt/Decrypt Toggle**: Radio buttons to select the operation mode.
- **Submit Button**: Processes the input according to the selected mode.
- **Output Text Area**: Shows the resulting encrypted or decrypted text.
- **Save Output Button**: Lets the user download the result as a text file.
- **Reset Button**: Clears all input fields and resets the form.

### **How the Algorithm Works**

- **Encryption**:
  1. For each line, iterate over its characters.
  2. For each character, XOR it with a value derived from the password (password character code at position `i % password.length` plus the line’s length).
  3. The result is then Base64-encoded for safe output/sharing.

- **Decryption**:
  1. Base64-decode each line.
  2. XOR each character with the same key logic as above to recover the original.

### **Use Cases**

- Protecting sensitive text data in a simple way.
- Encrypting/decrypting CSV or plain text files using a password.
- Quick, client-side (browser-based) encryption/decryption without uploading data to a server.

---

### **Security Note**

- The encryption method (simple XOR with a key derived from the password and line length, then Base64) is **not secure** for serious use. It can be easily broken and should only be used for obfuscation or trivial purposes.

---

**Summary:**  
This HTML file provides a browser-based tool to encrypt/decrypt lines of text or file contents with a password, using a basic XOR cipher and Base64 encoding. It’s useful for simple obfuscation, not for strong security.
